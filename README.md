# Fraud-Detection
Fraud is a common problem in auto insurance claims,health insurance claims, credit card transactions and financial transactions.
In this problem we have used Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification techique to identify whether a claim made was fraudulent 
or not and performed hyperparameter tuning using random search and grid search.The data in this particular case comes from an actual 
auto insurance company.
